# Splendid Suns: A Visual Journey of Resilience and Hope

**Splendid Suns** is a beginner-level 3D animation project created using Blender, inspired by *A Thousand Splendid Suns* by Khaled Hosseini. This animation explores powerful themes of **resilience, hope, and identity** through symbolic storytelling.

- A **moving desert sequence** expressing journey and strength
- Integration of **audio** and a meaningful **quote** to deepen the narrative impact

The project demonstrates creativity, storytelling, and growing proficiency in Blender's animation tools.
